A summary of political parties' aims are often condensed into a manifesto. A good API function has its spec. A tinder profile has its bio{% include footnote.html text="In an hypotetical world where personality actually matters." %}. This blog is neither a code project (although it will probably contain code), nor is it an internet dating profile (although if awkward ramblings on random topics make you swoon don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact/)). Neither is it a political party, but manifestos don't only apply to those.

A *manifesto* is a published declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party or a goverment <TODO find a quote with a number of pages>
