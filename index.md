Hi! I'm Kuba - a technologist by trade and an environmentalist by heart. Lover of bike-packing, honest food, touching music and bad puns. This is the beginning of my very unfinished (or barely started) website. A lot of what you see here is still a part of the template I used to get it on its feet but that should hopefully change soon as it gets populated with all kinds of content.
